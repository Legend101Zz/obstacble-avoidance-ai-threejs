# Project Name: YUKA AI Library - Simple Car Model
This project demonstrates the use of the YUKA AI JavaScript library to build a simple car model that can avoid obstacles in its path. The YUKA AI library is a powerful tool for building intelligent agents, and this project showcases its capabilities in a practical application.

# Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to have a basic understanding of JavaScript and the YUKA AI library. You can download the library from the official website, and you can find documentation and tutorials to help you get started.

# Building the Car Model
The car model in this project is a simple 3D object that is controlled by the YUKA AI library. The model is designed to move forward until it detects an obstacle in its path, at which point it will use the YUKA AI library to calculate a new path to avoid the obstacle.

The YUKA AI library provides a range of functions for building intelligent agents, including pathfinding algorithms, obstacle detection, and decision-making processes. These functions can be used to create a wide range of intelligent agents, from simple autonomous vehicles to complex robots.

# Running the Application
To run the application, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. This will load the car model and start the simulation. You can use the arrow keys to control the movement of the car, and you can add obstacles to the environment by clicking on the screen.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power and versatility of the YUKA AI library for building intelligent agents. By using the library's functions for pathfinding and obstacle detection, we were able to create a simple car model that can avoid obstacles in its path. With further development, this model could be expanded to include more complex decision-making processes and a wider range of behaviors.
